The figure example_tree.jpg shows the tree topology used in the example input files, which is the same tree topology used in our study.
There are four observed species (leaf nodes), the indices of which are 2,5,6,7.
The indices of the nodes in the figure correspond to the indices of nodes used in edge.1.txt.
The branches are indexed as b1...bK, which correspond to their order in the branch_length.1.txt.
